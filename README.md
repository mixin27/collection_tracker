## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with **MVVM** pattern:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Presentation Layer              │
│  (UI, ViewModels, Widgets, State)       │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│          Domain Layer                    │
│  (Entities, Use Cases, Repositories)     │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│           Data Layer                     │
│  (Models, Repository Impl, DataSources)  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 📦 Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI framework
- **Riverpod**: State management with code generation
- **Drift**: Type-safe local database
- **Go Router**: Declarative routing
- **Freezed**: Immutable data classes
- **fpdart**: Functional programming (Either type)
